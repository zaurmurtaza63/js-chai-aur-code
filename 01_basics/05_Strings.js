let fullname = "Ghulam Murtaza";
let fatherName = ' Fateh Khan';

console.log("my name is " + fullname + " and my father name is " + fatherName);   // this is bad way to concotinate .

// using backtick
console.log(`My name is ${fullname} and my father name is ${fatherName}`);  // this is the correct way to continate and use backticks.
