/*
There are two types of data types in JavaScript:
1. Primitive Data Types
2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types


1. Primitive Data Types:
   - Stored in stack memory
   - Changes are made by value
   - A copy of the value is created

   Primitive data types are:
   1. String
   2. Number
   3. Boolean
   4. Null
   5. Undefined
   6. BigInt
   7. Symbol


2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:
   - Stored in heap memory
   - Changes are made by reference
   - Changes affect the original value

   Non-primitive data types are:
   1. Object
   2. Array
   3. Function
